# Drive.NET Element Querying

Use this skill when you need to find UI elements, understand why a selector does or does not match, traverse the element tree, read properties, or extract grid data from a connected Windows desktop application.

## `query` Tool

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionId` | string | Yes | - | Session ID from `session connect`. |
| `action` | string | Yes | - | `find`, `resolve`, `explain`, `tree`, `properties`, `bounds`, `children`, `parent`, or `gridData`. |
| `by` | string | No | - | JSON search criteria for `find` or `resolve`, such as `{"automationId":"txtUsername"}` or `{"controlType":"Edit","name":"Username"}`. |
| `path` | string | No | - | Hierarchical selector path for `find` or `explain`, such as `Pane[automationId=MainPanel] > Button[name=Save]`. |
| `matchIndex` | int | No | - | 1-based match position after selector filtering. |
| `elementId` | string | No | - | Element ID from a previous query. Required for `properties`, `parent`, and `gridData`. Optional for `children` and `tree`. |
| `rootElementId` | string | No | - | Search root for `find`, `resolve`, or `explain` instead of the session root. |
| `windowHandle` | string | No | - | Top-level window handle to use as the query root for `find`, `explain`, `tree`, or `children`. |
| `maxDepth` | int | No | `3` | Max tree depth for `tree` (0-25). |
| `maxNodes` | int | No | `250` | Maximum number of returned nodes for `tree` before the response is truncated in-band (1-5000). |
| `detail` | string | No | `summary` | `summary` or `verbose`. |
| `annotateArtifacts` | bool | No | `false` | For `tree`, annotate probable framework/provider artefacts such as offscreen WinUI placeholders without changing tree membership. |
| `scope` | string | No | `descendants` | `descendants`, `children`, or `subtree`. |
| `maxResults` | int | No | engine default | Maximum results for `find` or `explain` (1-5000). |
| `fallback` | bool | No | `false` | For `find` and `resolve`, try alternative selector strategies if the primary selector returns no matches. |
| `searchAllWindows` | bool | No | `false` | For `find` and `tree`, search across all visible windows for the session process instead of one rooted surface. |

## Actions

### `find`

Search for elements matching either a `by` JSON selector or a hierarchical `path`.

```
query sessionId="..." action="find" by='{"automationId":"txtUsername"}'
query sessionId="..." action="find" by='{"automationId":"SubmitButton"}'
query sessionId="..." action="find" path='Pane[automationId=MainPanel] > Button[name=Save]' matchIndex=2
query sessionId="..." action="find" by='{"controlType":"Edit"}' scope="children" rootElementId="e_panel1"
query sessionId="..." action="find" by='{"automationId":"CloseButton"}' windowHandle="0x1A4F"
```

`find` returns an object with `queryRoot` plus `elements`. Inspect `queryRoot` when you need to confirm whether the search ran from the session root, a specific element, or a specific window handle.

Equivalent duplicate matches that share the same selector-visible identity and bounds are collapsed automatically. When this happens, the response also includes `duplicatesCollapsed`.

### `resolve`

Resolve exactly one fresh element id from a selector without dumping a larger result set.

```
query sessionId="..." action="resolve" by='{"automationId":"ThemeComboBox"}'
query sessionId="..." action="resolve" path='Pane[automationId=MainPanel] > Button[name=Save]' matchIndex=2
```

`resolve` returns `queryRoot`, `elementId`, and `element` when the selector is unique. If the selector resolves to zero or many elements, it returns a focused error instead of forcing a full tree walk.

### `explain`

Return structured selector diagnostics without acting on the UI. Use this before a click, inspect, or wait when the selector is uncertain.

```
query sessionId="..." action="explain" path='Pane[automationId=MainPanel] > Button[name=Save]' matchIndex=2
query sessionId="..." action="explain" by='{"automationId":"SubmitButton"}'
query sessionId="..." action="explain" path='Button[name=OK]' windowHandle="0x1A4F"
```

### `tree`

Return an object with `queryRoot` and a nested `tree` array of element info objects with children. The response also includes `nodeCount`, `truncated`, `maxNodes`, and `continuationHints` when the subtree is larger than the returned budget. Use `elementId` to scope to a smaller subtree.

```
query sessionId="..." action="tree"
query sessionId="..." action="tree" maxDepth=5 detail="verbose"
query sessionId="..." action="tree" maxDepth=4 maxNodes=150
query sessionId="..." action="tree" elementId="e_panel1" maxDepth=2
query sessionId="..." action="tree" windowHandle="0x1A4F" maxDepth=2
```

When `truncated` is `true`, pick one of the returned `continuationHints[*].elementId` values and rerun `query action="tree"` against that subtree instead of retrying the whole window.

When `searchAllWindows=true`, `tree` returns `windowTrees` instead of one merged tree so you can inspect each visible window independently while the overall node budget stays bounded.

When a `windowHandle`-rooted tree query detects that the popup window exposes significantly more elements through targeted search than through recursive tree walking (a known WinUI/UIA provider behavior), a `popupTreeDiagnostic` block is included with `treeNodeCount`, `searchableDescendantCount`, and guidance to use `find` or `resolve` for element discovery on that popup.

When a browser session has its accessibility runtime disabled (e.g. Firefox with `accessibility.force_disabled = 1`), `tree` responses include a `browserAccessibilityDiagnostic` block explaining why page content is not queryable. `find` queries against such a browser short-circuit to empty results with the same diagnostic, preventing unreliable chrome-only matches from being returned.

### `bounds`

Return element coordinates in screen and window-relative spaces, plus click-point diagnostics.

```
query sessionId="..." action="bounds" elementId="e_abc123"
```

`bounds` returns `screenBounds`, `screenBoundsSource`, `uiaBoundingRect`, optional `popupRelativeBounds`, `windowRelativeBounds`, `hostWindow`, `clickablePoint`, and `clickResolution`.

- `screenBoundsSource` is `nativeWindowRect`, `uiaBoundingRect`, `dwmExtendedFrameBounds`, `appMetadata`, or `mixed`.
- `uiaBoundingRect` is the raw UIA bounding rectangle when available.
- `popupRelativeBounds` is included when Drive.NET detects popup-relative UIA coordinates and translates them to produce `screenBounds`.
- `hostWindow` includes `source`, authoritative `bounds`, `boundsSource`, `nativeWindowRect`, optional `uiaBoundingRect`, optional `boundsDeltaFromNative`, optional `dwmExtendedFrameBounds`, optional `appMetadataBounds`, and `suspectReusedPopup` so popup-rooted descendant queries preserve their popup-host association.
- When a popup descendant exposes an intermediate bridge handle instead of the popup HWND, Drive.NET normalizes that handle up to the top-level popup host before populating `hostWindow`.
- When native bounds look sentinel-like and UIA is also origin-like, Drive.NET tries DWM compositor bounds as a revalidation source. If DWM returns anchored bounds, `boundsSource` becomes `dwmExtendedFrameBounds`.
- When native, UIA, and DWM all still report sentinel-style coordinates for a visible popup, Drive.NET marks `suspectReusedPopup=true` and searches the popup subtree for app-emitted metadata such as `helpText="...; popup=x,y,w,h"`. When found, `hostWindow.boundsSource` becomes `appMetadata` and `appMetadataBounds` contains the parsed popup rect.

### `properties`

Return verbose single-element detail, including `className`, `helpText`, supported patterns, and other diagnostic properties.

```
query sessionId="..." action="properties" elementId="e_abc123"
```

### `children` and `parent`

Navigate the element tree around a known element.

```
query sessionId="..." action="children" elementId="e_abc123"
query sessionId="..." action="parent" elementId="e_abc123"
```

`children` also returns `queryRoot` so callers can verify the effective root.

### `gridData`

Read table or grid content from controls that support the Grid or Table UIA pattern.

```
query sessionId="..." action="gridData" elementId="e_grid1"
```

## Selector Strategy

- Prefer `by` with `automationId` first. It is usually the most stable selector.
- Combine `controlType` and `name` inside `by` when `automationId` is absent.
- Use `path` only when sibling repetition or container context matters.
- Use `matchIndex` only when duplicate matches are expected and their order is stable.
- Use `scope="children"` and `rootElementId` to keep searches narrow and deterministic.
- Use `windowHandle` for modal dialogs or secondary top-level windows when you do not want to retarget the whole session.
- Use `searchAllWindows=true` for popup or flyout discovery when you do not know the right secondary window handle yet.
- Check `queryRoot` in `find`, `tree`, and `children` responses before acting on results from a secondary window.
- When `hostWindow.boundsSource` is `uiaBoundingRect` for a popup host, Drive.NET rejected a misleading hidden-popup native sentinel rect in favor of a materially different anchored UIA rect.
- When `hostWindow.boundsSource` is `dwmExtendedFrameBounds`, Drive.NET used DWM compositor bounds because both native and UIA reported sentinel or origin-like coordinates for a reused popup host.
- When `hostWindow.boundsSource` is `appMetadata`, Drive.NET used popup geometry parsed from app-emitted UIA metadata because the raw Win32/UIA/DWM path stayed on the hidden-popup sentinel.
- For popup `windowHandle` roots with `boundsSource="appMetadata"`, `find`, `resolve`, `tree`, and `children` normalize popup-root and popup-descendant `boundingRect` values into corrected screen-space coordinates before returning them.
- When `hostWindow.suspectReusedPopup` is `true` and `hostWindow.appMetadataBounds` is absent, use app-emitted `helpText` or `itemStatus` for authoritative popup geometry.
- When `screenBoundsSource` is `mixed`, inspect `popupRelativeBounds` and `hostWindow` together. Drive.NET translated the raw UIA rect using the popup host bounds because the provider looked origin-relative instead of screen-relative.
- `searchAllWindows` is mutually exclusive with rooted queries such as `rootElementId`, `elementId`, and `windowHandle`.
- `fallback=true` is available for `find`, `resolve`, and `searchAllWindows` searches. When combined with `searchAllWindows`, fallback is tried per-window when the initial search yields no results.
- Element IDs are session-scoped and transient; re-query or `resolve` again after reconnects or meaningful UI refreshes.

## Diagnostics-First Workflow

1. Start with `query action="find"` using `by='{"automationId":"..."}'`.
2. If that fails or returns too many matches, run `query action="explain"` against the same selector.
3. When the selector is stable and you only need one fresh element id, switch to `query action="resolve"`.
4. If the selector is still weak, switch to `path` or narrow the search with `rootElementId` and `scope="children"`.
5. Use `tree` only on the smallest useful subtree, not the entire window. If it still truncates, pivot to a hinted subtree root.
6. Use `inspect` after the selector is stable and the target is unique.

## Name Mismatch Heuristics

- If searching for a noun such as `Settings` fails, try an action-oriented accessible name such as `Open settings`.
- UIA control types differ from framework names: `TextBox` maps to `Edit`, and `Label` or `TextBlock` maps to `Text`.
- If a control exists but cannot be found by name, explain or dump a focused subtree around the expected container to discover the actual names.

## Complex Query Patterns

### Batch Element Discovery

When automating a form, discover all needed elements in a single batch to reduce round-trips:

```json
[
  { "tool": "query", "action": "find", "automationId": "txtName", "saveAs": "name" },
  { "tool": "query", "action": "find", "automationId": "txtEmail", "saveAs": "email" },
  { "tool": "query", "action": "find", "automationId": "btnSubmit", "saveAs": "submit" }
]
```

### Selector Triage Before Interaction

Use `explain` before you commit a batch or a direct interaction to a brittle selector:

```json
[
  { "tool": "query", "action": "explain", "path": "Pane[automationId=MainPanel] > Button[name=Save]" },
  { "tool": "query", "action": "resolve", "path": "Pane[automationId=MainPanel] > Button[name=Save]", "saveAs": "save" }
]
```

### Reading Grid Data For Assertions

After populating a data grid, read its contents to verify row counts and cell values:

```
query sessionId="..." action="find" by='{"automationId":"dgResults"}'
query sessionId="..." action="gridData" elementId="e_grid"
```

### Hierarchy Exploration

When you do not know the structure, start shallow and drill down:

```
query sessionId="..." action="tree" maxDepth=1
query sessionId="..." action="children" elementId="e_mainPanel"
query sessionId="..." action="tree" elementId="e_tabControl" maxDepth=3 detail="verbose"
```
